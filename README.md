# How to write a cover letter : A Step-by-Step Guide for Job Seekers
Cover letters are formal business documents, and using the correct format demonstrates your professionalism and attention to detail, making you appear more capable and qualified.
 Here are some guidelines to keep in mind:

- Use single-spaced lines within paragraphs, and leave a space between each paragraph.
- Choose a professional font, such as Times New Roman or Arial, with a font size of 12 for readability.
- Set one-inch margins on all sides of the page.
- Include a header with your contact information, the recipient’s contact information, and the date

* When attaching your cover letter as a digital file, it’s best to follow the company’s preferred file format, if specified. Some employers may prefer a PDF (.pdf) to preserve formatting, while others might request a Word document (.doc). If no specific format is mentioned, submitting the document as a PDF is generally a good choice, as it helps maintain the original layout across different devices.
